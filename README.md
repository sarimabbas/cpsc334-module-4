#### Video demo

#### Requirements

- [x] You must use a minimum of (2* number of group members) motors and may use as many motors as you have available to your group
- [x] The device must have an enclosure or enclosures
- [x] The device must be safe to operate over long periods of time. For instance, if you have continuous motion, you should **provide a switch** that allows a user to switch off the actuators
- [x] The device utilizes actuators
- [x] Reuses previous sensors, **config code**, **design principles**

#### Goals & vision
